# Phish-Net
The new phishing detection tool is implemented right into your Gmail through a Google Chrome extension.

Part of the reason why phishing is such a prevalent problem is how itâ€™s evolved over time. It's become more sophisticated, more automated, and traditional security solutions just can't keep up.

Our application shines light on this matter by using OpenAI to combat and detect phishing emails, while also teaching users to become more aware of the potential dangers hiding in their inbox.

We were able to build this extension using a tech stack of  Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, and of course the OpenAI and Gmail APIs.

We believe this style of combating phishing attempts is the new way to protect individuals.
